# Car-Price-PRediction
### About the data:
This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

- name
- year
- selling_price
- km_driven
- fuel
- seller_type
- transmission
- Owner

Problem Predict the price of the car 

It is a regression type supervised machine learning dataset.Because price is the numerical feature.

Machine learning model used:

1. Linear Regression
2. Support vector machine with hyperparameter 
3. Random Forest Regressor

Accuracy of the model for training score : 98 %
accuracy of the model for testing score mean r^2 score : 96 %
R^2 is used to check the performance of the model. When the value of the R^2 is near to 1 that means model is good 
and when R^2 is near to zero means model is not good
